          Notes: This project belongs to Ania Kubow. I only made javascript
          practice by rewriting the code. <br />
          &emsp; Issues i had: I am pretty sure Ania Kubow made it without
          issues but i had to deal with some. <br />
          <br />
          My finished code: <br />
          couldn't fill first row if the match happened in the first row, <br />
          bottom rows didnt match properly, <br />
          valid moves had a missing logic: in order to move candies in original
          candy crush you need to make a match but candies were moving freely as
          long as it is a neighbouring candy. <br />
          *I fixed these issues, but again , i dont say Ania Kubow made it wrong
          i might have missed something when im practicing.
          <br />
          After i finished the code i couldn't test every possible action due to
          candy crush being a hard game(especially 4 & 5 candy matches). So
          please let me know if you encounter unexpected behaviour:
